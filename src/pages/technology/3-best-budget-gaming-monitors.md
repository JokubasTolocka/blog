Depending on your budget, a great gaming monitor can be hard to find. It may be hard to believe, but you don't need to spend a thousand to have a decent gaming experience. Budget monitors can still offer low input lag and a fast refresh rate now more than ever. We've looked at top monitors under 500$ that serve the purpose and also do it exceptionally well.

### 1. ASUS TUF GAMING VG259QM

This Asus model really stands out with its high refresh rate which goes up to 280Hz. It features a standard 1080p HD IPS display and supports FreeSync. Being 25 inches in diameter it really suits all purposes, movies, gaming and even editing/image work. Overall, we consider this a great option for those really striving for an exceptional gaming monitor. Get yours at Amazon.

### 2. Gigabyte G27Q - Best Budget 1440p

This is by far the best budget monitor if you want that higher 1440p resolution. It features a lower 144Hz refresh rate, which, to be fair, is still more than enough for most users. Comparing this one to Asus, it also has a bigger screen - 27 inches. Gigabyte G27Q is suitable for any user, supporting wide viewing angles and low contrast ration making it perfect for darker rooms. The input lag is very low and it also has native FreeSync support and G-SYNC compatibility. Get yours at Amazon.

Acer Nitro XV340CK offers a 144Hz refresh rate, a flat, non-curved 34 inch 21:9 display, giving you about 30% more display than your average monitor. Definitely an immerse gaming experience. One amazing feature is that it can display two input signals with its Picture-by-Picture mode, making it expremely useful for streamers who want to see their game and the stream at the same time.
