Nothing is more annoying than having to spend 5 minutes searching for your charging cable. That is why we always prefer charging stands. Not only are they very convenient, they also act as a nice decoration to your workdesk. Among many charging stands this one stands out for its clean design and simplicity. Even thought the manufacturer isn't Apple, they nailed the aesthetic. Get yours on Amazon.

Never having to worry about tangled cables (Let's admit, it's pretty annoying). Another amazing thing about this model - noise cancelling. As this is starting to become an industry-standard it is definitely worth considering grabbing these. Get yours on Amazon.
