As technology moves forward, houses are becoming more and more advanced. Simple electricity doesn't do the job anymore. People need devices to assist them with their daily routines and we've picked a few for you. We all know the pioneers in smart-home technology like Amazon's Alexa and Google Home, but today we take a look at some of the lesser-known tools for an easier life.

### 1. ConnectSense Smart Outlet 2

This is a must-have for people who want to be more environment-friendly. ConnectSense Smart Outlet 2 is a simple electricity outlet that helps you monitor your electricity usage through your phone. In fact, you even need to press buttons on your phone, it also works with voice assistants like Alexa or Google Home and responds to your voice! Get yours on Amazon.

 Arlo Ultra is one of the top-tier outdoor security cameras. It supports motion tracking, zooming, night vision, 4K video recording and integrated siren. You will have to sign up for Arlo's subscription plan to get the full benefits, but honestly, the free plan is more than enough. Get yours at Amazon.

This small device provides full house monitoring from your phone, PC or the 7-inch tablet itself. The additional components come at a price, but the perk is that Vivint technicians come and set everything up themselves. After that, you don't need to lift a finger. Get yours at Vivint.

### 5. Yeelight Smart LED Bulb

Coming in as the cheapest item on the list, it still probably is the most desirable. With 16 million colours and an option to dim the light, it is a purchase worth considering. Just like everything on the list this one also responds to voice commands and you toggle the settings on your phone. We have looked at many smart light bulbs but none of them offer as much functionality for a reasonable price. Get yours at Amazon.
