If you're looking to buy a new smartphone then our best phones guide is designed to show you the top handsets on the market today in 2021.

This best phones list shows the mobile devices that we recommend above all others, no matter their maker, OS, size, type or cost.

However, if you already know what type of phone, maker or OS that you want to invest in, then we've also got specialist guides to things like the [best Android phones](https://www.t3.com/features/best-android-phones) or [best iPhones](https://www.t3.com/features/every-iphone-apple-is-still-selling-ranked).

### **1. Apple iPhone 12**

Apple has outdone itself with the four iPhone 12 models launched in late last year, and if you can't stretch to the price of the Pro editions then the standard [iPhone 12](https://www.t3.com/reviews/iphone-12-review) could well be the best phone for you. It's packed with power and comes with a stylish new design, though Apple's handsets are still at the more expensive end of the scale.

5G has been added to the iPhone this year of course, which means you're future-proofed when it comes to next-gen connectivity. The A14 Bionic processor is more power than you're really going to need, while the improved dual-lens rear camera system can take spectacular photos in any kind of light.

We also really like the flatter design that Apple has introduced for the iPhones this year. Add to that the choice of cool colours – white, black, blue, green and red – and it's a really impressive overall package. Unless you have a real affinity for Android, this could well be the smartphone for you.

### 2. OnePlus 8 Pro

OnePlus' ascension to the top smartphone table is complete with the OnePlus 8 Pro, which is a simply jaw-dropping handset that delivers across the board. It is, simply put, the best phone on the market for those shopping for a premium Android handset.

There are so many reasons why the OnePlus 8 Pro is so special, but first among them is its simply astonishing 120Hz, QHD+, HDR10+ screen, which is the best display ever seen on a mobile phone. Other premium phones have delivered part of that holy trio of screen features, but none has managed to do them all at once.

The OnePlus 8 Pro also comes with a simply rapid suite of top-shelf internal hardware, next-gen 5G connectivity and a selection of advanced phone features like reverse wireless charging and IP68 water and dust proofing. Naturally, as this is a phone from OnePlus, the design and ergonomics are also fantastic.

Choosing the right phone is no easy task, as there are so many on the market and, truth be told, many of them are *very* similar. There are some core questions you should ask yourself before pulling the trigger on a smartphone upgrade, though.

Firstly, you need to establish if you're going to buy the phone SIM free (as in buy the phone outright upfront) or on contract. Both these options have their own strengths and weaknesses.

For example, buying a phone outright, and especially if it is a premium handset, can cost a lot of money, so you need to be able to swallow that. Once the phone is bought, though, then it is yours and you can go about getting one of the [best SIM only deals](https://www.t3.com/features/sim-only-deals-2020), which offer better allowances for less money.

On contract purchases are great in the sense that they often put the phone in your hand for comparatively very little money or even for nothing, but then you need to pay for the phone over the period of your contract, which is tied to a network SIM plan that, most of the time, doesn't offer as good allowances or value as a SIM only one.
