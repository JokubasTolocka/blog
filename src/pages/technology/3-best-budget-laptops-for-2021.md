Featuring an Intel Core i5-i7 (depending on the model) and 8GB of RAM it is definitely up to today's standards. One outstanding quality about this one is that Asus always know how to make bright and colourful screens, although we would have to say that the ScreenPad (trackpad) is a bit strange. If you're looking for a powerful mid-range laptop this one is the way to go. Even though it hasn't been out for long, it's definitely up there with our top laptops for this year. Buy Now at Amazon.
