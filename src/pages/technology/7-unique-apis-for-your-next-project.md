Need some inspiration for a new project? In this article I'll go over what I think are 7 of the coolest APIs around that make it quick and easy to build impressive projects. Whether you just want something to help you get a job or create a side project that earns you some money, all of these APIs are valuable.

## 1. Shodan API

![Shodan](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--U4qXuVLd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/3uxrhgm4jgee2bpu3bxy.JPG "Shodan")

You can think of Shodan as Google for every device connected to the internet. They crawl the web and catalog devices. You can sign up for a developer account and programmatically access their data and filter based on numerous factors. Some things people have found exposed and unsecured on Shodan:

* A French hydroelectric plant control system
* entire cities transportation grids
* databases
* industrial freezers with 10's of thousands of dollars in goods
* car washes that can be remotely shut down

With Shodan you are really only limited by your imagination, just make sure you don't get yourself arrested.
