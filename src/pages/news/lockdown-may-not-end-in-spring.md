**It is "too early" to say whether England's Covid restrictions will be able to end in the spring, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said.**

Once the four priority groups have been vaccinated, by mid-February, "we'll look then at how we're doing," he said.

Nearly two million people in the UK have had their first dose of vaccine in the past week, government figures show.

Scientist Marc Baguelin, who advises the government, has said restaurants and bars should not reopen before May.

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson [has said he "certainly hopes" schools in England can fully reopen](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-55747064) before Easter, while Downing Street refused to be drawn on whether this would happen by then.

A further 1,290 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test and there have been another 37,892 cases, according to the latest government figures.

And almost five million people in the UK have had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine.

Meanwhile, Home Secretary Priti Patel has announced that fines of £800 for anyone attending a house party of more than 15 people [will be introduced in England from next week](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-55757807).

These can be doubled up to a maximum of £6,400 for repeat offences.

Ms Patel told Thursday's Downing Street briefing that a "small minority" refused to "do the right thing", saying: "To them my message is clear, if you don't follow rules then the police will enforce them."
