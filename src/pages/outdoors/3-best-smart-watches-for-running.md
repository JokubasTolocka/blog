Running is becoming more and more popular. Equipping yourself with a fitting smartwatch can get a bit confusing. They come in a wide range of features, price and comfort. Accurate GPS tracking should be at the very top of your priority list. Apple or Samsung watches might suit you if you're a casual runner, but if you're considering training for a marathon, there are better options available. That's why we've gathered a list of the best running smartwatches for any budget.

### 1. Coros PACE 2

This lightweight, feature-packed mid-range watch is a great option for road runners. Being just 29g, you barely feel it on your wrist, but don't let the weight fool you. It packs many features, some of them you only expect to find on high-end ones like 'AI trainer' which helps you manage the training load for preparation for events like marathon, triathlons or just to improve your PR. Another great feature is that it's compatible with third-party sensors like chest-strap heart monitors. The only downside would be that the screen is a little dim, but overall it's a great bang for the buck.

### 2. Garmin Instinct Solar

If you're looking for a watch that doesn't need to be plugged in every few days, then Garmin Instinct Solar is the one for you. It's a super tough watch and thanks to its photovoltaic glass, it can go weeks without charging. Garmin have never failed with their GPS tracking and this one is a prime example of that. Together with a pulse oximeter that tracks oxygen levels in your blood and heart rate variability, this watch will show you your stress levels throughout the day so you can take action to control them. It has many other great features like TracBack navigator that helps you get back on your track and it supports Garmin InReach satellite communications if you're really off-grid. The only downside is its plastic shell which certainly doesn't make it the best looking watch out there, but you can be assured it tough.

### 3. Coros Apex

If you're a serious runner looking for a watch on a budget, Coros Apex is a great choice providing valuable insights for your training. It features great GPS tracking and Intelligent Stride Algorithm helps to keep an accurate record if your run takes you to a tunnel. The provided navigation tools are impressive if you're looking to change up your training routes. Just like Coros PACE 2, the screen is a little dim, but the gesture-activated backlight solves this issue neatly without draining too much battery.
