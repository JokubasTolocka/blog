### What is the best mountain bike?

There is no single best mountain bike. Mountain bikes come in different designs depending on what their intention may be. A mountain bike for racing cross-country is not the same as a mountain bike intended for weekend trail riding. As such, the round-up of the best mountain bikes available in 2021 features winning bikes from different disciplines within the broad church that is mountain biking. We’ll go through the differences in disciplines futher down this guide, but first let’s break things down by price points.

At least all of the stuff mentioned for the ‘£500 to £1000’ bikes above, plus… A select handful of full-suspension bikes are decent options at this price point. BUT, a hardtail is going to be lighter and significantly better specced. Fat tyre hardtails (with 2.6in + tyres) should be considered and test ridden if you’re after a trail bike. Look for a single chainring drivetrain, ideally 11-speed or higher. A suspension fork with more damping adjustment and tuning potential (volume spacers etc). Dropper seatposts are nice. Hardtails will be split by riding disciplines (XC, Trail, Enduro) so choose your weapon wisely. SRAM NX or Shimano SLX drivetrain (or better). Short stem. Wide handlebars.
