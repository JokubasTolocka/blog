Choosing the best road bike for you is a big decision. Prices and available options cover a huge range. What they all have in common is two wheels and drop bars. Beyond that there are loads of things to think about if you’re looking to buy a new road bike.

We’ve tested hundreds of road bikes here at *Cycling Weekly*, so here is our top advice for choosing our pick of the best road bikes at different prices. With each product is a ‘Buy Now’ or ‘Best Deal’ link. If you click on this then we may receive a small amount of money from the retailer when you purchase the item. This doesn’t affect the amount you pay.

## What do you want to do on your road bike?

A key decision when choosing the best road bike for you is what you plan to do. Are you looking to go fast or race, or are you after a more comfortable bike for more leisurely rides? 

A full-on race bike will put you in a more bent riding position, with your head and shoulders lower down over the handlebar. That’s great for fast riding and lowers your frontal profile to lower your wind resistance but can be uncomfortable, particularly for a beginner.

On the other hand, bikes labelled “endurance” or “sportive” will be designed for a more upright riding position, with the bars higher and closer to the saddle. That makes for more comfort on longer rides, but may make you a bit slower.
