### 1. Decathlon Triban RC500 Disc 

![Decathlon Triban RC500 Disc](/uploads/decathlon.jpg "Decathlon Triban RC500 Disc")

The Triban RC500 is definitely one of our favourites. It's equipped with an aluminium frame, disc brakes and a clean black look. It’s an altogether new frame following the French brand’s re-design and includes modern touches such as dropped seat stays for greater comfort and it is paired to a carbon fork with an aluminium steerer.

It’s also nice to see a hybrid and touring bike that has all the requisite ports and bolt holes. True to form, the Triban RC500 comes with a full suite of pannier rack ports and mudguard holes.
