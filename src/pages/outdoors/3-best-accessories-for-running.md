Running is an excellent cardio exercise and a great sport overall. Many runners have tools to make their runs more enjoyable like a watch that conveniently tracks it or a water bottle to keep hydrated. If you're looking for items to buy to make your runs enjoyable you've come to the right place!

### 1. Smartwatch

A smartwatch is a great investment. It helps you track your runs, measure your heartbeat and many other functions, some of them even have contactless payment, so you head straight to the shop after your runs without picking up cash. When it comes to watches, there are many options, but we have our favourites. Garmin has been well-known for making durable, reliable, and even somewhat stylish sports watches if classic is your way to go. 

Garmin Instinct is an excellent choice featuring an extra-long battery life (14hours), sleep-tracking, many activities and it's waterproof. It is definitely a great option for people looking to buy their first affordable smartwatch for working out. While it may not have a touch screen, the 5 buttons on the sides make it incredibly easy to navigate.

If you're looking for a smartwatch with a touchscreen, Garmin Vivoactive 3 is a brilliant choice, featuring long battery life, a touchscreen, many activities and contactless pay. I use this one myself and I can guarantee that it has not let me down yet. You can pair this watch with Strava and the runs get automatically posted as soon as you turn on Bluetooth on your phone. Brilliant!

### 2. Running Armband

If you're grabbing your phone on a run, you have probably found yourself wondering if there's a better way than keeping it in your pocket, luckily, there is. A running armband is an excellent item to get. It can store your phone, keys and any necessary cards. One thing to note when buying an armband is that some of them don't have a clear screen protection film if you want to change a song or reply to a message. This one has got it all, it's water-proof, sweat-proof, comfortable, and a great bargain!

### 3. Water Bottle

We believe this goes without saying but water is essential for when you're on your run. There are many options when picking a water bottle, but we love this one because not only does it store water, it also has a little pouch for keeping your stuff. It's small, portable and features a strap to attach it to your hand so you don't need to worry about losing it.
