From Gucci to Tom Ford and Balenciaga, luxury sneakers have become an essential element of every man’s casual wardrobe. Designer sneakers are now perfectly acceptable to wear from the gym to the office. You can comfortably wear them with a pair of jeans for an [elegant casual look](https://luxe.digital/lifestyle/style/men-casual-dress-code-guide/) or dress them up with a suit for a [business casual style](https://luxe.digital/lifestyle/style/men-business-casual-dress-code-guide/). Sneakers offer a level of style, versatility, and comfort that other shoes just can’t match.

With luxury sneakers, you’re getting premium fabrics and materials from high-end designers and luxury brands.

**They are expensive, yes.** But you’re getting a level of attention to details and craftsmanship that mass-market brands can’t deliver.

It doesn’t mean that you have to pay a fortune for your designer shoes, however. For each luxury sneaker listed below, our stylists hand-picked a budget-friendly high-quality alternative from brands such as Adidas, Nike, and Converse. Traditional sports and athletic wear brands have branched out to design classic streetwear shoes that can also look elegant.

Every sneaker featured on our list can become your go-to shoes for most days of the week. Men’s premium casual shoes are versatile, stylish, and functional. **We think it’s money well spent.**

**In a rush?** Here’s our editorial selection of the top three best sneakers available right now:

## 1. Oliver Cabell Low 1 Frost: Best minimalist men’s sneakers

The **Nike Air Max 270** is quite simply the most popular men’s sneaker of 2021. This low-top pair comes in a range of colours, shown here in simple black and white faux-suede. Nike’s signature lightweight React rubber sole makes it also one of the most comfortable sneakers to wear all day long.
