### 1. Nike SB Zoom Blazer Mid Edge

A combination of two skate classics joins forces into one silhouette with the upcoming Nike SB Blazer that dons aspects of the Dunk Low Pro and the iconic Blazer. While combining the two without a rugged design would be conventional, Nike SB has a bigger plan for the silhouette that arrives with multiple layers of different materials and an unsettling unfinished design. Get yours at Nike.

Going with a similar style, Nike Blazer Mid '77 embody a more futuristic-looking design. If you like the silhouette of the converses and PF flyers of the world but want them to have a bit more body to them, then these Blazer mid ‘77s are for you. These Nike classics never go out of style and only look better when they get worn. If you’re looking to add to your daily shoe game, these go perfectly with any colour pants (outside of red) you’d like. Get yours at Nike.

Following a similar colour pattern, like Nike Blazer Mid '77, these classics go well with anything. From 1982 to today, the [](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=130982X1593172&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nike.com%2Ft%2Fair-force-1-07-mens-shoe-JkTGzADv%2F315122-001)Nike Air Force 1 has exploded in popularity and is seen on the feet of athletes and models alike. Although there have been small dips in its popularity, the shoe has remained at the forefront of fashion, as it continues to quickly sell out and produce new models. As fashion recycles itself, the Air Force 1 is always able to find its place by staying fresh and sleek! Get yours at Nike.

#### 4. Zoom Freak 2 'Letter Bro'

These days it is all about colours. That is why these Nike sneakers immediately caught our attention. Giannis Antetokounmpo’s signature [](https://www.kicksonfire.com/tag/nike-zoom-freak-2/)Nike Zoom Freak 2 is slated to drop in a special “Letter Bro” theme next, as the distinctive moniker is a homage to his name. According to the Swoosh, he’s called “Letter Bro” in China because there are so many letters in his last name. Capturing the overall theme is prominent on the tongue and heel area with an alphabetic jumble print, while the style’s wide range of colours include neutral sail, warm desert sand, alongside camellia blue, dark sulfur yellow and dark red to complete the style. Get yours at Nike.

### 5. Nike Air Max Zephyr EOI

Futuristic is probably the best way to describe this pair. Splashes of no-sew skins and stitched overlays keep heritage athletics DNA while super-breathable tactile mesh and visible Air accents add to the sleek design. Celebrating the journey of Air Max, it blends graphics, materials and colours from other icons. Get yours at Nike.
