### 1. AGOLDE Charlie Denim Jacket

A [denim jacket](https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/g17846224/best-denim-jean-jacket-outfits-for-women/) is a year-round staple, but there's nothing better than putting it on for the first time again in 70-degree weather. 

### 2. Oversized Shell Jacket

When the hair-flowing-in-the-wind is back (not the I-can't-feel-my-face-wind) grab this colorblocked windbreaker for a sportier look.
