You could be forgiven for thinking that the spring/summer 2021 collections – and the subsequent raft of spring/summer 2021 trends – were something of a damp squib. Certainly, thanks to the ongoing pandemic, it was a season like no other. 

Of the four fashion capitals, New York and [London](https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/gallery/midriff-flossing-ss21-trend) opted for predominantly digital showcases, with the odd designer hosting [Covid-secure](https://vogue.co.uk/tags/coronavirus) presentations for small numbers of press and buyers; while Milan and [Paris](https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/article/paris-fashion-week-ss21-verdict) held scaled-back showings with strict social distancing measures in place from some of its biggest brands. Others still opted to try something different. “Different” manifested variously as: showing off-schedule, [showing via film](https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/article/fashion-film-renaissance) and in virtual reality, or sending a replacement for a catwalk experience out to press and buyers in a box. All enjoyed varying degrees of success.

## Monochrome Magic

In a world with no simple answers or even straightforward questions, designers showed a predilection for black and white – most often, together. At Dolce & Gabbana, chequerboard patchwork dresses utilised archive rolls of fabrics from previous collections, while at Chanel, crisp layering semaphored a new mood of restraint. Meanwhile, at Ports 1961 and Gabriela Hearst, black and white dresses looked just the kind of elegant, no-fuss eveningwear we’ve been longing for.
